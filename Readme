This code is for a guessing game where the player tries to 
guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. When the 
player clicks the "check" button, the code checks if the player's
guess is correct, too high, or too low. If the player's guess is correct, 
a message is displayed and the player's score is compared to the highscore. 
If the player's score is higher than the highscore, the highscore is updated.
If the player's guess is too high or too low, their score is decremented by 1 
and displayed on the page. If the player's score reaches 0, the game is over
and a message is displayed. 
The player can also click the "again" button to start
a new game with a new random number and reset the score and highscore.
